## about me

This is the professional blog of James Ferguson, it was started in January, 2011. 

I've been a professional web developer since 2002 and have a combined B.Arts/B.Science from the University of Sydney with majors in Computer Science and Linguistics.

I worked in Java until late 2006, then PHP until late 2009 before entering the promised land of Ruby on Rails.

I like Agile, TDD/BDD and best practices in general.

## code etc

These are a few bits and pieces to show how awesome I am:

### LinkedIn

[My LinkedIn profile][linkedin_profile] has most of my resume details and the odd recommendation.

[linkedin_profile]: http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=46824040

### github

I have [a GitHub profile][github_profile]. There's some stuff there including this blog.

The most developed project (as of Sep 2011) is tv-shows which scrapes the online offerings of the major TV channels and allows users to subscribe to shows and a feed of new shows. There's a live version of tv-shows, with the working name all-the-episodes. You can check it out by subscribing to [the new TV shows feed][all_the_episodes] in your favourite RSS feed reader/aggregator.

### Stack Overflow

[The ubiquitous Q&A site for programmers][stack_overflow] has a system of badges and reputation points to track your contributions (and, let's be honest, to get you addicted to the site). My profile is a bit bare because I've only been active since Nov 2010.

### Git Achievements

[Git Achievements][gitachievements] is a clever little plugin for git that gives you videogame-style points and level-ups based on the number and variety of git commands you use. It then automatically publishes those achievements to a GitHub Pages project page.

Mine is [here][my achievements].
