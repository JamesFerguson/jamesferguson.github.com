        <p>Since getting into BDD and Cucumber I&#8217;ve been getting mixed messages about what should be covered by features and what shouldn&#8217;t.</p> <p>Firstly, as with TDD, I&#8217;m told that BDD tests are so important they should be written before you touch the code. But then, conflictingly, I&#8217;ve had a number of people suggest that if a feature is mostly provided by a gem or plugin or Rails itself then you needn&#8217;t test it.</p> <p>Now, granted, for TDD/Rspec I tend to agree - it&#8217;d be futile to go spec-ing every magic method provided by Rails or Devise.</p> <p>In the case of BDD/Cucumber however, I disagree.</p> <p>Some brief reasons&#8230;

        <p>I once tried and failed to write a cucumber test for a remember-me login feature. I was using Webrat to drive Cucumber interactions at the time and it just didn&#8217;t seem to provide the access to cookies I needed. So I logged a feature request with Webrat and left the test marked <code>pending</code>.</p> <p>Fast forward to more recent times and I was cukeing login features but using Capybara to drive it. So when it came to the remember-me feature I tried again hoping that Capybara might be more supportive. It wasn&#8217;t directly, but thanks to this <a href='https://gist.github.com/484787'>nifty little gist</a> I was able to hack in what I needed.</p> <p>The gist,&#8230;
