<h2>patching devise</h2>

<p>I submitted my first patch to an open source Ruby project the other day.</p>

<p>I got interested in the <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HttpOnly#Cross-site_scripting_.E2.80.93_cookie_theft'>HttpOnly</a> flag on cookies and decided to check up on which cookies set it. After a little more fiddling than should have really been required (see the side note) I was able to establish that the Rails session cookie is <code>HttpOnly</code> by default (since about 2.2 or 2.3).</p>
<div class='sidenote'>
<h4>Checking the HttpOnly flag in Chrome</h4>

<ol>
<li>Switch to the tab with the page the cookie is set for.</li>

<li>Open Tools &gt; Developer &gt; Developer Tools (Alt + Cmd + I)</li>

<li>Switch to the Storage tab</li>

<li>Click the item under &#8216;Cookies&#8217; (localhost in my case).</li>
</ol>

<p>Look at the &#8216;HTTP&#8217; column. There&#8217;ll be a tick if the cookie is <code>HttpOnly</code>. For example the rails session cookie, called _session_id by default, should have one.</p>
</div>
<p>However, I noticed Devise&#8217;s <code>remember_&lt;scope&gt;_token</code> cookie used for the remember-me feature wasn&#8217;t. Since a remember-me cookie is essentially a super session cookie, and Rails&#8217; session cookie is <code>HttpOnly</code> by default, I figured Devise&#8217;s default needed to change.</p>

<p><a href='https://github.com/JamesFerguson/devise/blob/56e55726c8cdc920f48c97187c7fe8b9d2baddc6/test/integration/rememberable_test.rb' title='See the whole file'>The test</a> ended up being a single line adding an assertion to an existing test:</p>
<script src='https://gist.github.com/805027.js?file=56e55726c8cdc920f48c97187c7fe8b9d2baddc6.diff' type='text/javascript'>&nbsp;</script>
<p>It asserts that the server response after submitting a remember-me login will include a &#8216;Set-Cookie&#8217; header that has a line that begins <code>remember_user_token</code> and ends <code>HttpOnly</code>.</p>

<p><a href='https://github.com/JamesFerguson/devise/blob/5f98caca1b192c30f1f3774a365a66f786958cae/lib/devise/hooks/rememberable.rb' title='See the whole file'>The change</a> itself was one line:</p>
<script src='https://gist.github.com/805027.js?file=5f98caca1b192c30f1f3774a365a66f786958cae.diff' type='text/javascript'>&nbsp;</script>
<p>It just passes through an additional option.</p>

<p>I put these changes in a pull-request and sent it along to the Devise guys and Jose Valim very kindly merged it into <code>master</code>. Amazingly he appears to have found time to do that on Christmas Day (unless GitHub&#8217;s handling of timezones is fooling me).</p>

<h3 id='httponly'>HttpOnly</h3>

<p>Modern browsers support an <code>HttpOnly</code> flag for cookies that tells the browser to lock the cookie against access from Javascript. If Javascript can&#8217;t access your cookie, then attackers can&#8217;t exploit <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting'><abbr title='Cross-site scripting'>XSS</abbr> vulnerabilities</a> to harvest your session cookie and impersonate you to the site.</p>

<p>Such session harvesting is the most flexible way to use an <abbr title='Cross-site scripting'>XSS</abbr> vulnerability to escalate privileges. But even with an <code>HttpOnly</code> session cookie a site with an <abbr title='Cross-site scripting'>XSS</abbr> flaw would still be vulnerable to a &#8217;<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HttpOnly#Cross-site_scripting_.E2.80.93_just_do_it'>just do it</a>&#8217; attack. That is, rather than embedding a script to harvest the user&#8217;s session and then doing something dastardly on his own machine, the attacker could simply embed a different script that directly does something dastardly and have it run on the user&#8217;s own machine.</p>

<p>However a &#8216;just do it&#8217; attack is probably a little more constrained because the malicious script has to get by both the site&#8217;s (admittedly already at least partially faulty) input filtering as well as any browser limitations on Javascript. It&#8217;s also a more complex script than session harvesting and has to be run blind.</p>
