You've taken thousands of stunning photos with your new, expensive
 camera and uploaded them to your Mac. So now what? 

This is a very basic guide about how to use your favourite photos 
as rotating desktop wallpaper or in your screensaver. Rather than
 having to do something tedious like manually putting favourite 
photos in a special folder or a special album we'll piggyback on 
iPhoto's rating system so any photo rated 4 or 5 stars is 
automagically used in or collection of top photos.

Ok. So we can break this into two parts; first we want to create a 
Smart Album that'll automatically include all of your top rated 
photos. Second you can set your wallpaper and/or screensaver to 
rotate randomly through the photos in that album.

### Part 1: The Smart Album

1. In iPhoto click the File menu, click New and choose Smart Album...
1. Give the Album a name, e.g. 'Top Rated'
1. In the first drop down choose 'My Rating' and in the second choose 'is greater than'
1. Where the 5 empty stars are click the middle one to indicate 3 stars (i.e. 'greater than' +  '3 stars' = any photo rated 4 or 5 stars)
1. Click 'OK' and you should see your new album on the left under 'Albums'
1. Go to the 'View' menu and ensure 'Ratings' is ticked, then click on a photo and you should see some empty stars.
1. Click on the 4th star from the left to give the photo a rating of 4 stars. You should now see it come up in the Top Rated album.

### Part 2: Using the Smart Album

#### A. For Your Desktop Wallpaper

1. Open the System Preferences app.
1. Choose Desktop & Screen Saver
1. Select the Desktop tab
1. If necessary expand the iPhoto section
1. Choose the Top Rated album.
1. Tick 'Change picture' and select a schedule, e.g. Every 30 minutes
1. Tick 'Random order' to ensure you end up seeing all the photos.
1. You might also want to change the way the image is presented (Stretch, Center, Tile etc), no option is going to work perfectly for every image. I use 'Fit to Screen'.

#### B. For Your Screensaver

1. Do 1 & 2 above and then select the Screensaver tab
1. In the left side menu choose the Top Rated album.
1. Choose a display style: Slideshow, Collage or Mosaic
1. Choose 'Options...' and tick 'Present slides in random order' and anything else that you want (I tick them all except the last one)
